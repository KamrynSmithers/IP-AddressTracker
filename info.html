<h2 id ="h2New">First of all.. What is an IP Address?</h2>
<p id="newPageIP"> An IP (Internet Protocol) Address serves as a unique identifier for every device connected to the internet. 
    It's the key for sending and receiving the correct data your computer requested.
    Think of it as an electronic home address for online requests. It tells your computer where to send data, and where the data came from.

<ul>
    <li>Banks can use your IP address as part of security monitoring to help detect fraud on your bank account. </li>
    <li>If you’re a regular user, you’re most likely logging in from similar IP addresses on the same devices.</li>
    <li>When fraud occurs, the hacker usually enters your account from a significantly different IP address and device.</li>
    <li>Banks compare the difference in IPs and login behaviors to confirm fraud activity. Most public IPs are searchable. Including yours! Look below: <div id="searchShow">
