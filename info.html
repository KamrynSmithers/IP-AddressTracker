<h2 id ="h2New">First of all.. What is an IP Address?</h2>
<p id="newPageIP"> An IP (Internet Protocol) Address serves as a unique identifier for every device connected to the internet. 
    It's the key for sending and receiving the correct data you requested.
    Think of it as an electric home address for online request. It tells your computer where to send data, and where the data came from.
